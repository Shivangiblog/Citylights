<p id="1"><h3>What this privacy statement covers</h3></p>
This privacy  statement tells you about our privacy practices for our websites, products,  online and web services, and apps that include a link or reference to this  statement.  It also tells you about our  marketing and advertising practices, and applies to our offline practices.  In this statement we will refer to our  products, online and web services and apps as &ldquo;applications.&rdquo;  
<p>Some of our websites and applications may display supplemental privacy  or data collection notices that we share so you can make informed choices about  what you want to do when you review the notices.  For example, you may see a notice explaining  data collection practices for an application, and your choices for  participating.  In special cases,  websites and applications may have their own privacy policies.  For example, we may buy another company to  expand our business, and need some time to integrate the company&rsquo;s privacy  practices with ours.</p>
<p>Third parties  (such as social media platforms or other company websites that we link to from  our websites and applications) are responsible for their own privacy  practices.  Be sure to read the privacy  policies, supplemental notices, and settings of all websites or platforms that  you visit so you can understand their privacy practices and your options.</p>
<p>Some websites  and applications are subject to additional terms such as our website <a href="http://usa.autodesk.com/adsk/servlet/index?siteID=123112&amp;id=786919">terms of use</a>, <a href="http://usa.autodesk.com/adsk/servlet/index?siteID=123112&amp;id=17752585">terms of  service</a>,  and <a href="http://usa.autodesk.com/adsk/servlet/index?siteID=123112&amp;id=10235425">software  license agreements</a>.  Please read the terms that  apply to the website or application you are using.  These terms can help answer questions you may  have about the confidentiality and security of designs and other content you  create, and the effect of sharing and posting of content by you. </p><p><a href="#top">Back to Top</a></p><p id="2"></p><h3>How to contact us

    <li>calculate and control the number of unique and  repeat views of a given ad </li>
    <li>deliver ads that relate to your interests, and </li>

  <p>Some technology enables advertising to be temporarily  uploaded onto your mobile device and replaced while you are online.&nbsp; <br />
    <br />
    We do not actively share personal information with our Ad  Partners or third party advertisers for their direct marketing purposes unless  you give us your consent.&nbsp; Our Ad Partners deliver ads for us and may  combine the information collected or obtained from us with other information  they have independently collected from other websites and/or other online or  mobile products and services relating to your browser's activities across their  network of websites.&nbsp; <br />

  <p><em>Public information access by third-party applications</em></p>
 <blockquote> <p>On some websites and applications,  content you post is public and cannot be marked as non-public or private.  Check the posting controls for the specific  application or website you are using.</p>
  <p>
    Where there is an option to mark  content as private or otherwise choose a non-public status, and you choose the  non-public option, third party developers will not be able to access the  following information through a public information access API:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>the content  (including its title, and public comments you include with the content);</li>
    <li>the name (or  pseudonym) associated with your account;</li>
    <li>the profile  image associated with you;</li>
    <li>the profile URL  (which may include user ID) for the account.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>If your content is &ldquo;public&rdquo; but you do  not want developers to have access to your real name or profile image (for  example, if it is a picture of your face), use a pseudonym or &ldquo;handle&rdquo; and use  a profile image that does not consist of a picture of you.</p></blockquote>
  <p><em>Authenticated access by  applications</em></p>
  <blockquote><p>You may choose to use third party  applications that manage your interactions with our websites or applications.  For example, third party applications may  want to do the following types of activities:</p>

    <li>Manage content: to post and remove content on your behalf; </li>
    <li>Manage likes: to manage likes and similar actions on your behalf;  and</li>
    <li>Manage comments: to manage and post comments on your behalf.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>We require the app developers to  explain what actions they will take and also what information (including  personal information) they need to access in  order to take these actions, and to get your approval.  In addition, we require developers to provide a link to an explanation of their  privacy practices.</p><p>
